# Wess: A WebAssembly Execution and Storage Service

Wess is a high-level WebAssembly execution and storage service designed to provide
efficient and easy-to-use WebAssembly function execution. The service allows you to
store and run WebAssembly modules with just a few lines of code, abstracting away the
complexities of compilation, linking, and module instantiation.

Key Features:

- **Efficient Execution**: Wess provides a streamlined execution environment for
  running WebAssembly functions, reducing overhead and improving performance.
- **Caching**: Wess leverages a caching system to store frequently accessed data
  in memory, improving the overall performance of the service.
- **Concurrency**: The service is built with concurrency in mind, allowing for
  efficient execution of multiple tasks simultaneously.
- **Storage**: Wess uses RocksDB for storing WebAssembly modules, providing a
  fast and reliable storage solution.

The main components of Wess include:

- `database`: The module responsible for managing data storage using RocksDB.
- `logger`: A utility module for handling logs and terminal output.
- `server`: The module that implements the Wess server and API endpoints.
- `workers`: A set of modules that manage the execution of WebAssembly functions,
  including reader, writer, and runner.
